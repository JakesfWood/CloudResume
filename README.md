# CloudResume

My Cloud Resume repository.  

I am going to be posting the source code for my cloud resume website on this github and documenting the process here.

Currently, I am hosting my site on AWS using S3 static hosting, Cloudfront to enable SSL encryption, DynamoDB plus Lambda and API Gateway for a visit tracking API and ACM for SSL Certificates.
